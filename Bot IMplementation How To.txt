How to implement your Bot?

You have to implement the BotControllerFactory with the correct name BotControllerFactoryImpl in the package de.hsa.games.fatsquirrel.botimpls.
You also implement BotController in a class with arbitrary name, but it must be unique to prevent naming collisions. 
In the nextStep method you call from the ControllerContext the move method to move.
ControllerContext also provides some methods where you can watch the field.
